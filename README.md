## Which package/library does the sample program demonstrate?
The sample program, "JumpIt.py", demonstrates the Python Arcade Library

## How does someone run your program?
To run the program you first need to install the Arcade module with
```pip install arcade``` 
They recomend you do this in a virtual environment
After that make sure "JumpIt.py" and the assets folder are in the directory you wish to run the game from
It can then be ran in the terminal using ```python JumpIt.py```
When you wish to exit, just close the game window.

## What purpose does your program serve?
My program is a simple one screen game that demonstrates some of the functionalities that Arcade provides, such as keyboard controls, a physics engine, and an interactable map with collison detection. It also serves the purpose of fun, it is a game after all. The object of the game is to make it to the end with as many points as possible. If you hit a spike, you will be sent to the start and lose some points, but that spike will also be removed making future runs reasier.

## What would be some sample input/output?
You can control the game with WASD or the arrow keys and you can reset the game at any time using the R key. Sample input would be moving around and interacting with the game, output is what you see on the screen.
